# spicanfd
Add a CAN-FD interface to a microcontroller through SPI. Uses the MCP2517FD chip + ATA6561 transceiver.

Based on [Longan Labs' CAN FD Shield](https://github.com/Longan-Labs/Longan_Labs_CAN_FD_Eagle/) for the Arduino Uno. It's basically a breakout board form of that. Their shield is nicer to use but this board is a lot cheaper to fab since it's smaller and has less components.

For usage, please refer to the [MCP2517FD datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/MCP2517FD-External-CAN-FD-Controller-with-SPI-Interface-20005688B.pdf) and the [acan2517FD](https://github.com/pierremolinaro/acan2517FD) Arduino library.
